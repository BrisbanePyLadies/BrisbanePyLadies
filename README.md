# BrisbanePyLadies

  We are the Brisbane PyLadies Chapter, a mentorship group with a focus on helping more women become active participants and leaders in the Python open-source community.

Our mission is to promote, educate and advance a diverse Python community through outreach, education, conferences, events and social gatherings.

PyLadies also aims to provide a friendly support network for women and a bridge to the larger Python world.

Any women (+1 male guest) with an interest in Python is encouraged to participate!

Brisbane PyLadies is dedicated to providing a respectful, harassment-free community. Please read & follow our Code of Conduct:http://www.pyladies.com/CodeOfConduct/
